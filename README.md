# Iternarary-planner
The website will function as an Itinerary planner. Where the user can search for a location or city and allows them to pull up points of interest. We can save information on the location(s) in a collection

## Description

Our website uses the Google and Wikipedia APIs, in order to create a cohesive experience in collecting information on a variety of locations of interest. This is where our website differentiates itself from google maps. The user can gather and save all the information about different locations all conveniently in one spot. If the user doesn’t happen to finish in one sitting, no problem! The user can save all their progress and return back later to finish  or reference.

## Usage

Type in the name of the locatino your interested into search for. Once that's done the googlemap will generate places of interest around the location. As the user clicks on the markers this will save the names of the locations along with a wikipedia link if applicable to the bottom card. If the user is happy with the results they can create a collection and save the card to the collection. 

These collections can be saved locally should they need to come back later.
